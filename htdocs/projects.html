    <h3>Perl 6 Modules</h3>
    <p>I have written a few different modules for the Perl 6 programming
    language.</p>
    <h3>Bots</h3>
    <p>I played the programming game 'ATRobots' when I was younger, and this
    is/was an attempt to create a core game engine with similar rules.</p>
    <h3>WebMessageQueue</h3>
    <p>Message queue based apis are awesome. But public-facing message based
    apis don't exist in any kind of standard format, and integrating message
    based with REST apis is always interesting. This is my initial prototype
    to fix that.</p>
